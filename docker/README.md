## 🏃 Steps to run a docker container of the Big Data Harvest Server

#### 1. Update the Big Data Harvest Server configuration file.

* Get a copy of the `harvest-server.cfg` file from https://github.com/NASA-PDS/big-data-harvest-server/blob/main/src/main/resources/conf/harvest-server.cfg and
keep it in a local file location such as `/tmp/cfg/harvest-server.cfg`.
* Update the properties such as `rmq.host`, `rmq.user`, `rmq.password` and `es.url` to match with your deployment environment.

#### 2. Update the following environment variables in the `run.sh`.

| Variable                   | Description |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| HARVEST_SERVER_CONFIG_FILE | # Absolute path for the Big Data Harvest Server configuration file in the host machine (E.g.: `/tmp/cfg/harvest-server.cfg`) |
| HARVEST_DATA_DIR           | Absolute path for the Harvest data directory in the host machine (E.g.: `/tmp/data/urn-nasa-pds-insight_rad`) |

```    
# Update the following environment variables before executing this script

# Absolute path for the Big Data Harvest Server configuration file in the host machine (E.g.: /tmp/cfg/crawler-server.cfg)
CRAWLER_SERVER_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/cfg/crawler-server.cfg

# Absolute path for the Harvest data directory in the host machine (E.g.: /tmp/data/urn-nasa-pds-insight_rad)
HARVEST_DATA_DIR=/tmp/data
```

#### 3. Open a terminal and change the current working directory to `big-data-harvest-server/docker`.

#### 4. If executing for the first time, change the execution permissions of `run.sh` file as follows.

```
chmod u+x run.sh
```

#### 5. Execute the `run.sh` as follows.

```
./run.sh
```

Above steps will run a docker container of the Big Data Harvest Server.
